IDEA: 

Basically I want to be able to create PDF's in different size format, starting with A4,
from JSX/TSX files that will also work with typescript.

Ideas: 
-use webpack or Babel to convert the jsx/tsx into html and css. 
- Do I need to create/find some sort of method to convert the tailwind? Can I just 
    get the file to include the relevant classes from the Tailwind directory?
